## directions:
Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose. 
For example, we saw the -name option for find in class. For each of those options, 
give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./written_2. 
Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.
Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out about it as a URL or a description of where you found it.
